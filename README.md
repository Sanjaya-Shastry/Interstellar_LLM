# LLM-Transformers (interstellar)

This is a mini transformer-based language model (LLM) built from the scratch using TensorFlow and NumPy, implementing
manual tokenization, embedding, positional encoding, and scaled dot-product attention. The model is trained on the Interstellar movie script and temperature-controlled text generation is added.
